## Features  
- **Switch Footprints:** Preplaced switch footprints ready for customization.  
- **RGB Support:** Prelaid RGB LED footprints to add per-key or underglow lighting.  
- **Column and Row Layouts:** Matrix wiring prepared for easy routing.  
- **Pre-Routed Microcontroller Connections:** Includes basic connections for popular microcontrollers like Pro Micro or Elite-C.  
- **Split Support:** Includes provisions for TRRS jack and I2C communication for split keyboards.

## Quick Start  

### Option 1: Clone the Repository  

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**  
   Download the files to your local machine and open the project in KiCad.  

2. **Customize the Layout**  
   - Open the PCB layout and schematic in KiCad.  
   - Replace or rearrange the switch footprints to match your desired layout.  
   - Adjust RGB LED placement as needed.  

3. **Modify the Schematic**  
   - Ensure that the column and row connections align with your new layout.  
   - Update microcontroller pin assignments if necessary.  

4. **Route the PCB**  
   - Use the existing traces as a guide for your routing.  
   - Connect switches, LEDs, and other components.  

5. **Export Your Gerbers**  
   - Once your design is complete, generate Gerber files and send them to your preferred PCB manufacturer.  

### Option 2: Use the KiCad Template System  

1. **Install the Template**  
   Copy the template folder to your KiCad template directory (e.g., `~/Documents/KiCad/Template` on most systems).  

2. **Create a New Project from Template**  
   - Open KiCad and click **File > New Project > New Project from Template**.  
   - Locate the "Split Keyboard PCB Template" and create a new project based on it.  

3. **Proceed with Customization**  
   Follow steps 2â€“5 from the first option to customize and route your design.
