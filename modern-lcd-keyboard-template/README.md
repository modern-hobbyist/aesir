# Modern LCD Keyboard Template

> **Note:** This PCB is untested. I made updates to this design to address issues I had with the previous version, but I haven't ordered boards, nor have I written the matching firmware for it.

This is a starter template for a Keyboard PCB to help you get started quickly with the right footprints and supplemental components to get it done right.
