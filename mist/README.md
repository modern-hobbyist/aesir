# Hermod Mk. II

> **Note:** This PCB is untested. I made updates to this design to address issues I had with the previous version, but I haven't ordered boards, nor have I written the matching firmware for it.

Hermod Mk. II is a redesign of my original Hermod split keyboard, which in turn was my second keyboard design ever! Some issues that were resolved in this version include:
- Better Pin choices for PWM Channels, Mk. I had some issues with timers overlapping
- Added a handedness pin 
  - Allows me to avoid using flash to store handedness
- Switched to Full Duplex split comms
  - Mk.I was missing a 5.1kÎ© resistor on the split serial line and this switched fixes that.
- Switched to `STM32G474CETx` from the `STM32F072CBT6`
  - More Ram, more flash, more fun. Didn't have enough ram for fun graphics on the LCD
- Added PWM Backlight control for the LCD Display
