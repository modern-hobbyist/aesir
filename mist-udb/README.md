# Mist

> **Note:** This PCB is untested. I am working on getting an order together, but until I can verify it functions as expected, use at your own risk.

**Mist** is my take on a full size keyboard, but with some upgrades I carried over from my second keyboard build--**Hermod**. Furthermore, this is the UDB version of **Mist**, which stands for Unified Daughter Board

Aside from the UDB connector and the lack of USB-C/on-board ESD protection circuitry, this keyboard is functionally identical to the base **Mist** keyboard.

## Why?
1. First of all, I've addicted to designing custom keyboards now, so jot that down.
2. I have two children now, and while I love my split keyboard, typing with one hand is 100 times more difficult and time consuming on a split.
3. Related to above, I wanted a keyboard that would appeal to the non-split community, but also incorporated all the features I loved mose about my split build.

## Features

- **2.2" LCD Display**: A 2.2" LCD Display to show keyboard state, stats, and any fun animations I can think of.
- **Thumb Clusters in Place of Spacebar**: I loved the thumb clusters from my split keyboard and the giant spacebar is such a waste of space!
- **Connector for Unified Daughter Board**: A Unified Daughter Board extracts all the ESD and over-voltage protection from the main PCB and allows for more complex case shapes.
- **Per-Key RGB Lighting**: Vibrant, individually addressable RGB LEDs for endless customization.
- **KS-33 + MX/Gateron Normal Profile Hot-Swappable Switch Sockets**: Support for either KS-33 low-profile or MX style (Cherry or Gateron Normal profile) switches.
- **QMK Firmware**: Fully programmable and customizable using QMK.
- **Standard QWERTY Layout and Keymap**: The layout we all grew up learning to type on!

## Specifications

- **Microcontroller**: STM32G474RETx
- **Display**: 2.2" LCD (320x240 resolution) per half.
- **Lighting**: SK6812 Mini RGB LEDs.
